# About

Try the simulator at [queue.philipithomas.com](http://queue.philipithomas.com). 

This program was written for the Analysis and Simulation of Discrete Event Systems class at [Washington University in St. Louis](http://wustl.edu). The script suggests how many cashiers to have based on customer load and average service time. The script analytically solves an [M/M/c](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M/M/c_queue) queue client-side using Javascript.
